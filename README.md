Catùfol
=======

A helper tool on the top of Webpack, Karma, TypeScript and other tools that helps to reduce configuration
steps. The tool will try to work with a minimum of configuration and will use conventions and other project files
to extract configuration settings whenever it's possible.

### About the name

Catùfol is a Catalan word that is used to name the pots or containers that ares used to carry water in a water wheel or
_noria_. There is also a Romainan word (without the accent) that means _potato_. You can chose whichever
meaning you like more :)

## Conventions

Catùfol relays on folder structure and file name conventions in order to work properly. The main idea is to minimize
configuration settings, as a trade off, we need to follow some conventions on how we structure our app.

### Folders

```
yourApp/
├── app/                     // Here goes all your app code
│   ├── main.ts              // Your entry point file for Webpack
│   ├── helloTest.spec.ts    // Test files are expected to have the extension .spec.ts
│   └── index.html           // This is the HTML template used to generate the final index.html on your build
├── coverage/                // Generated folder. Coverage reports will be created here
├── build/                   // Generated folder. Your packaged files will be created here
├── typings/                 // Generated folder. Typings use this folder for type definitions
├── node_modules/            // Generated folder. NPM use this folder for keeping dependencies
├── catufol.json             // Catufol configuration file
├── package.json             // NPM configuration file
├── typings.json             // Typings configuration file
├── test.loader.json         // Karma entry point
└── tsconfig.json            // Configuration for the Typescript compiler
```

* `app` contains all the source files, including tests
* `build` will be used for generated files and its content will be deleted on every build. It should not be versioned
* `coverage` will contain the test coverage reports and it should also be ignored from version control

_As a general rule, avoid creating your own content in generated folders or files as they can be overwritten by different
tools._

#### Files

* `app/main.ts` entry point for the application
* `app/index.html` template to be used to generate the index.html file for loading the app
* `test.loader.js` entry point for Karma 

## Dependencies

* __Webpack__ This project is sort of a Webpack wrapper, without it, it doesn't make too much sense
* __TypeScript__ This project is very opinionated on languages and it assumes you'll use TypeScript, although it will
be compatible with JavaScript sources too
* __Karma__ It is assumed that your project is using Karma to run tests. No plans to support other tools
* __Jasmine__ For now we assume your project is using Jasmine for unit tests
* __NodeJS 5.0__ or greater


## Usage

Install it with NPM:
```shell
npm install catufol
```
    
You may want to add a configuration file `catufol.json`:

```
{
  "appName": "apps",     // It will default to your project name in package.json if not provided
  "devServerPort": 8081, // Defaults to 8080, changes the webpack dev server port
  "exportJQuery": true,  // Defaults to false, when true makes jQuery available in your modules as `jQuery`, `$`, and `window.jQuery`
  "vendors": [           // Modules included here will be included in a vendors.bundle.js file instead of bundle.js
     "reflect-metadata",
     "es6-shim"
     /* ... */
  ],
  "devEntryFile": "./app/main.ts",        // It will default to ./app/main.ts if not provided
  "prodEntryFile": "./app/main-build.ts", // It will default to ./app/main.ts if not provided,
  "karmaFiles": [/* ... */]               // This can be used to insert files in the files configuration for Karma.
                                          // If you need any.By default catufol will load some needed files.
}
```

It may be helpful to add some scripts to your `package.json` file:
```
{
  "scripts": {
     "build": "catufol -b",
        "start": "catufol -r",
        "test:debug": "catufol -i",
        "test": "catufol -t"
        /* ... */
        }
}

```

Test loader file for __Karma__ is expected to be on the root of your project and to be named `test.loader.js` and if
you are using AngularJS 2.0 it may look like this:

```javascript
Error.stackTraceLimit = 20;

var context = require.context('./app', true, /\.spec\.ts$/);
context.keys().forEach(context);
var testing = require('@angular/core/testing');
var browserDynamic = require('@angular/platform-browser-dynamic/testing');

testing.setBaseTestProviders(
    browserDynamic.TEST_BROWSER_DYNAMIC_PLATFORM_PROVIDERS,
    browserDynamic.TEST_BROWSER_DYNAMIC_APPLICATION_PROVIDERS
);
```

### Optional loaders

* **Sass** If you want to use Sass you will need to install a Webpack Sass Loader. A recommended version is **3.2.0**. Newer versions will use Webpack 2.0, which is not compatible with the current version of Catùfol.



### Build Folder

The generated `build` folder will have the following structure:

```
build/
├── yourApp/                            // The folder will be named with the same name you used in catufol.json
│   └── bundles/
│       ├── bundle.[sha].js             // Bundled file for your app
│       ├── bundle.[sha].js.map         // Source map for your main bundle file
│       ├── vendor.bundle.[sha].js      // Vendors code bundle
│       └── vendor.bundle.[sha].js.map  // Sourcmap for vendors code
├── buildinfo.json                      // A file containing details about the build
└── index.html                          // HTML that will work as your entry point
```

### CLI options

* `-t` `--test` will run unit tests once using PhantomJS. Commonly used in CI environments
* `-i` `--interactive` will run tests in interactive mode using Chrome
* `-hl` `--headless` will run tests using headless Chrome 
* `-r` `--run` will run Webpack Development Server
* `-b` `--build` will create the final artifacts using Webpack

### Testing

To run the tests, first install webpack and rxjs locally (do not save or include in package.json) with `npm i webpack`,
and `npm i rxjs`.

Run `npm test`.
